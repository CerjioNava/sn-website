# SERGIO NAVA - PERSONAL WEBSITE

This is my personal website, take a look!

I'm making it using some different tools, libraries, some free icons from 'flaticons', and my creativity.

**Front End:**
  - React
  - Three.js

**Back End:**
  - Node

Also, I've been using some of my old pixel art models that I created some time ago for my Unity video games.
